# OF-Scraper Plugin System Documentation

Welcome to the OF-Scraper Plugin API. The plugin system lets you extend OF-Scraper and its GUI without touching the core source code. Use it to add sidebar pages, integrate local AI models, run post-download pipelines, or inject UI controls into existing pages.

---

## Where Are Plugins Stored?

Plugins are loaded from the `plugins` folder next to your OF-Scraper `config.json`:

- **Windows:** `C:\Users\<YourUser>\.config\ofscraper\plugins\`
- **Linux/macOS:** `/home/<YourUser>/.config/ofscraper/plugins/`

The folder is created automatically on first launch if it does not exist.

Plugins are loaded in both **GUI mode** (`ofscraper --gui`) and **headless/CLI mode** (`ofscraper`). The only hook that is GUI-only is `on_ui_setup`.

---

## Plugin Structure

## Logging

Each plugin automatically gets its own dedicated logger via `self.log` from `BasePlugin`.

- Logger name format: `ofscraper_plugin.<Plugin Name>`
- Log files are written separately from the normal OF-Scraper logs
- Plugin log location follows OF-Scraper's normal log naming convention, for example:
  - rotated logs: `.../logging/<profile>_<YYYY-MM-DD>/plugins/plugin-<plugin-name>_<YYYY-MM-DD_HH.mm.ss>.log`
  - daily logs: `.../logging/plugins/plugin-<plugin-name>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.log`

Example usage inside your plugin:

```python
class Plugin(BasePlugin):
    def on_load(self):
        self.log.info("Plugin loaded")

    def on_item_downloaded(self, item_data, file_path):
        self.log.debug(f"Downloaded {file_path}")
```

Use `self.log.info(...)`, `self.log.warning(...)`, `self.log.error(...)`, and `self.log.debug(...)` freely — the plugin manager configures a per-plugin file handler automatically when the plugin is loaded.

### What gets logged automatically

The plugin manager now writes important plugin lifecycle events into the per-plugin log file automatically, including:

- plugin load failures
- missing dependency detection during plugin load
- dependency installer start / finish / failure
- full dependency installer output

That means a plugin log file should contain both:
- messages your plugin writes via `self.log`
- manager-driven lifecycle/install events that happen before the plugin can fully load

## Dependencies

If your plugin requires third-party packages:

1. list them in a `requirements.txt` file inside the plugin directory
2. OF-Scraper can prompt to install missing dependencies automatically
3. dependencies are installed into the plugin-local `deps/` folder
4. the installer now prefers a plugin-local virtual environment at `.deps_venv/` to avoid polluting the main OF-Scraper environment

This is especially important for pipx installs, where plugin dependencies should remain isolated from the main `ofscraper` application environment.

Dependency installer output is also written to the plugin's dedicated log file, so plugin authors and users can troubleshoot failed installs more easily.


Each plugin lives in its own subdirectory. The folder name is used as the plugin's internal ID.

**Minimum required file:** `main.py`

`metadata.json` is optional but strongly recommended. All other files are up to you.

```text
plugins/
└── my_plugin/
    ├── main.py           # Required — entry point, must contain a Plugin class
    ├── metadata.json     # Optional but recommended — name, version, description
    ├── requirements.txt  # Optional — pip dependencies; triggers install dialog if missing
    ├── __init__.py       # Optional — auto-created by the loader if absent
    ├── gui.py            # Your choice — split complex plugins across multiple files
    ├── database.py       # Your choice
    └── settings.json     # Your choice — persist user settings here
```

### `metadata.json`

```json
{
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "YourName",
  "description": "A short description shown in the GUI.",
  "api_version": 1
}
```

At load time, the manager injects an additional `"id"` key equal to the plugin folder name, so `self.metadata["id"]` always resolves to the directory name regardless of what you put in `metadata.json`.

---

## Enabling and Disabling Plugins

Add this line near the top of `main.py` to control whether the plugin loads:

```python
# Enabled 1 / Disabled 0 — default is 1 (enabled) if this line is absent
plugin_enabled = 1
```

Set it to `0` to make the Plugin Manager skip loading entirely without deleting the folder.

> **Important:** The check is a regex scan on the raw file text (`^plugin_enabled\s*=\s*([01])`) performed *before* the file is imported. The line must appear at the **start of a line with no indentation** and the value must be exactly `0` or `1`. Any other value is ignored and the plugin defaults to enabled.

---

## How Plugins Are Loaded

The Plugin Manager (`ofscraper.plugins.manager`) is a singleton. It runs `discover_and_load()` once at startup — from `main_window.py` in GUI mode, or from `main/open/load.py` in CLI mode.

For each subdirectory in the plugins folder it:

1. Checks for `main.py` — skips the folder if missing.
2. Reads `main.py` as text to check the `plugin_enabled` flag.
3. Parses `metadata.json` if present (not required).
4. Creates an empty `__init__.py` in the plugin folder if one does not already exist.
5. Registers the plugin folder as a Python package named `ofscraper_plugin_<foldername>`.
6. Imports `main.py` as `ofscraper_plugin_<foldername>.main`.
7. Looks for a class named exactly `Plugin` inside `main.py`.
8. Instantiates `Plugin(metadata=..., plugin_dir=...)` and calls `on_load()`.

Because the folder is registered as a package, **relative imports work**:

```python
from .database import init_db       # works
from .gui import MyTab              # works
from . import utils                 # works
```

---

## Writing a Plugin

### Minimal example

```python
# main.py
from ofscraper.plugins.base import BasePlugin

# plugin_enabled = 1  # default; set to 0 to disable without deleting

class Plugin(BasePlugin):

    def on_load(self):
        self.log.info("%s loaded!", self.metadata["name"])

    def on_item_downloaded(self, item_data, file_path):
        self.log.info("New file: %s  (type: %s)", file_path, item_data.mediatype)
```

### What `BasePlugin` gives you

`BasePlugin.__init__` sets three instance attributes before `on_load()` is called:

| Attribute | Type | Contents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `self.metadata` | `dict` | All fields from `metadata.json`, plus `"id"` = folder name |
| `self.plugin_dir` | `str` | Absolute path to your plugin folder |
| `self.log` | `logging.Logger` | Pre-configured logger named `ofscraper_plugin.<name>` |

You do **not** need to create your own logger or track the plugin directory manually.

---

## Available Event Hooks

Override any of these methods in your `Plugin` class. All hooks are called via `_safe_call`, so an unhandled exception will be logged but will **not** crash OF-Scraper.

| Method | Status | When it is called |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `on_load()` | **Active** | Right after the plugin is instantiated. Use for initialisation. |
| `on_ui_setup(main_window)` | **Active (GUI only)** | After the PyQt6 main window is fully built. |
| `on_item_downloaded(item_data, file_path)` | **Active** | Each time a media file is successfully saved to disk. Fires in both GUI and CLI mode. |
| `on_scrape_start(config, models)` | **Active** | Before the scrape begins. Must return the `models` list (may be modified). |
| `on_posts_collected(posts, model_username)` | **Active** | After each batch of messages is collected for a model during scraping. |
| `on_scrape_complete(stats)` | **Active** | When a scraping session finishes completely. |
| `on_unload()` | **Reserved** | Defined but not yet dispatched. |

### `on_item_downloaded(item_data, file_path)`

`item_data` is an ofscraper `Media` object — **not a plain dict**. The most useful properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `item_data.id` | `int` | Unique media ID from OnlyFans |
| `item_data.post_id` | `int` | ID of the parent post |
| `item_data.username` | `str` | Creator username |
| `item_data.mediatype` | `str` | `"Images"`, `"Videos"`, `"Audios"`, or `"Forced_skipped"` |
| `item_data.responsetype` | `str` | Source content type: `"Timeline"`, `"Archived"`, `"Stories"`, `"Highlights"`, `"Messages"`, `"Profile"` |
| `item_data.url` | `str \| None` | Direct download URL (`None` for DRM-protected content) |
| `item_data.filename` | `str \| None` | Base filename derived from the URL |
| `item_data.text` | `str` | Caption text from the parent post |
| `item_data.date` | `str` | Media creation date (ISO format) |
| `item_data.downloadtype` | `str` | `"Normal"` or `"Protected"` (DRM) |

`file_path` is the **absolute path string** of the saved file on disk.

```python
def on_item_downloaded(self, item_data, file_path):
    if item_data.mediatype == "Images":
        self.log.info(
            "New image from @%s — post %s: %s",
            item_data.username, item_data.post_id, file_path
        )
```

### `on_scrape_start(config, models)`

Called before the scrape begins. `config` is the current ofscraper config dict. `models` is the list of model objects that will be scraped. **Must return the models list** — you may filter or reorder it, but you must return it.

```python
def on_scrape_start(self, config, models):
    self.log.info("Scrape starting — %d models", len(models))
    return models   # must return, even if unchanged
```

### `on_posts_collected(posts, model_username)`

Called after each batch of messages is collected for a model. `posts` is a list of ofscraper Post/Message objects. `model_username` is the creator's username string.

This hook fires during the data-collection phase, before any files are downloaded. It gives you access to the raw message text and media metadata for every collected item.

Key properties available on each post object (via `post._post` raw dict):

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `text` | `str` | Raw HTML message body (includes full URLs inside `<a href>` attributes) |
| `media` | `list` | List of media dicts. Each has a `files` dict with `full` and `thumb` sub-dicts containing `url`, `width`, `height` |
| `createdAt` | `str` | ISO timestamp of when the message was sent |
| `id` | `int` | Message ID |
| `responseType` | `str` | Content area, e.g. `"message"` |

> **Note:** The `text` field is raw HTML. Use a library or regex to extract URLs or strip tags before displaying. The display URL shown in the OnlyFans UI is often truncated — the full URL is in the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag.

```python
def on_posts_collected(self, posts, model_username):
    for post in posts:
        raw = getattr(post, "_post", {})
        text = raw.get("text") or ""
        if "something_interesting" in text:
            self.log.info("Found match in message from @%s", model_username)
```

### `on_scrape_complete(stats)`

Called when the scraping session finishes. `stats` is currently an empty dict — it is reserved for future use.

```python
def on_scrape_complete(self, stats):
    self.log.info("Scrape finished.")
```

### `on_ui_setup(main_window)`

Called after the PyQt6 main window is built. `main_window` is the `QMainWindow` instance. See the **Adding a Sidebar Page** section below for the full pattern.

---

## Adding a Sidebar Page (`on_ui_setup`)

The most common GUI integration is adding a new page to the left navigation bar:

```python
def on_ui_setup(self, main_window):
    from PyQt6.QtCore import Qt
    from ofscraper.gui.widgets.styled_button import NavButton

    # 1. Create your page widget
    self.my_tab = MyTabWidget(self)

    # 2. Register it with the stacked page area
    main_window._add_page("my_plugin_page", self.my_tab)

    # 3. Create a navigation button and register it
    btn = NavButton("🔧 My Plugin")
    main_window._nav_group.addButton(btn)
    main_window._nav_buttons["my_plugin_page"] = btn

    # 4. Insert the button above the expanding stretch in the nav layout
    nav_layout = main_window._nav_frame.layout()
    stretch_idx = -1
    for i in range(nav_layout.count()):
        item = nav_layout.itemAt(i)
        if item and item.spacerItem() is not None:
            if item.expandingDirections() & Qt.Orientation.Vertical:
                stretch_idx = i
                break
    if stretch_idx >= 0:
        nav_layout.insertWidget(stretch_idx, btn)
    else:
        nav_layout.addWidget(btn)

    # 5. Connect the button to navigate to your page
    btn.clicked.connect(lambda checked: main_window._navigate("my_plugin_page"))
```

### Injecting widgets into existing pages

You can also inject widgets (e.g. a compact command bar) directly into existing pages:

```python
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QFrame

def on_ui_setup(self, main_window):
    action_page = getattr(main_window, "action_page", None)
    if action_page:
        layout = action_page.layout()
        bar = MyCommandBar(self, parent=action_page)
        sep = QFrame(parent=action_page)
        sep.setFrameShape(QFrame.Shape.HLine)
        layout.insertWidget(0, sep)
        layout.insertWidget(0, bar)
```

---

## Multi-File Plugin Layout

For anything beyond a trivial plugin, split your code across multiple files the same way the built-in plugins do. Since the folder is registered as a package, all relative imports resolve correctly:

```text
plugins/
└── my_plugin/
    ├── main.py          # Plugin class + hook implementations
    ├── gui.py           # PyQt6 widgets (tab pages, dialogs, etc.)
    ├── database.py      # Persistence layer (e.g. peewee ORM models)
    ├── engine.py        # Heavy processing / AI model logic
    ├── settings.json    # Runtime config written by the GUI
    └── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
```

```python
# inside main.py
from .gui import MyTab
from .database import init_db, MediaItem
from .engine import MyModel
```

---

## Plugin Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

If your plugin imports a package that is not installed, Python raises `ModuleNotFoundError`. The Plugin Manager catches this and:

1. Checks whether a `requirements.txt` exists in your plugin folder.
2. If it does, shows a GUI dialog listing the missing package with a one-click install button.
3. Detects the active install method (pip / pipx / uv) automatically and runs the appropriate command.
4. Shows a progress dialog while installing, then reports success or failure.

Include a `requirements.txt` listing all non-standard dependencies:

```text
torch>=2.0.0
Pillow>=9.0.0
peewee>=3.16.0
open_clip_torch
```

> **Note:** The install dialog only appears when the GUI (`QApplication`) is running. In headless CLI mode, the `ModuleNotFoundError` is logged but no prompt is shown.

---

## Accessing OF-Scraper Internals

Plugins run in the same Python process as OF-Scraper and can import any internal module:

```python
# Read the Discord webhook URL from ofscraper config
import ofscraper.utils.config.data as config_data
webhook_url = config_data.get_discord()

# Read per-run download counters (reset to 0 at the start of each scrape)
import ofscraper.commands.scraper.actions.utils.globals as cg
videos_this_run  = cg.video_count
photos_this_run  = cg.photo_count
audios_this_run  = cg.audio_count
skipped_this_run = cg.skipped
```

Use internal imports carefully — these APIs can change between OF-Scraper versions. Where possible, rely on the hook arguments rather than reaching into internals directly.

---

## Settings Persistence

Plugins are responsible for their own settings. The recommended pattern is a `settings.json` file inside `self.plugin_dir`:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

def on_load(self):
    self.settings_path = Path(self.plugin_dir) / "settings.json"
    self.settings = {"my_option": True}
    if self.settings_path.exists():
        self.settings.update(json.loads(self.settings_path.read_text()))

def save_settings(self):
    self.settings_path.write_text(json.dumps(self.settings, indent=2))
```

---

## Included Plugins

Three plugins ship with OF-Scraper GUI as references:

### Intelligent AI Tagger (`ai_tagger`)
Automatically tags every downloaded image using a local computer-vision model. Supports WD14 (Danbooru tags), OpenCLIP ViT-B-32 (zero-shot label matching), Florence-2 (generative captions), and custom fine-tuned `.safetensors` checkpoints. Adds a **Smart Gallery** sidebar page with tag search, semantic similarity search, and smart folder organisation.
- Uses `on_load` to initialise the model and a SQLite database (via `peewee`).
- Uses `on_ui_setup` to inject the Smart Gallery page into the sidebar and add a help button to the main Help page.
- Uses `on_item_downloaded` to run inference on each new image immediately after it is saved. Fires in both GUI and CLI mode.
- Dependencies: `torch`, `open_clip_torch`, `transformers`, `peewee`, `timm`, `Pillow`.

### JoyCaption Tagger (`joycaption_tagger`)
Sends downloaded images to a [JoyCaption](https://github.com/fpgaminer/joycaption) node running inside ComfyUI (local or Docker) and stores the returned captions in a SQLite database. Caption style and length are user-configurable in the settings panel.
- Uses `on_ui_setup` to add a settings/gallery page to the sidebar.
- Uses `on_item_downloaded` to submit each new image to the ComfyUI HTTP API. Fires in both GUI and CLI mode.
- Requires: a running ComfyUI server with JoyCaption custom nodes installed (see `docker/comfyui-joycaption/`).

### LLM Assistant (`llm_assistant`)
Adds a natural-language chat panel (**🤖 AI Assistant**) to the sidebar. Type plain English commands; a locally-running GGUF model (via `llama-cpp-python`) translates them into GUI actions such as setting usernames, toggling filters, and starting downloads. Also injects a compact command bar into the action and area pages.
- Uses `on_ui_setup` to add the full chat tab, inject compact bars into existing pages, and handle first-run model selection and download flow.
- Uses `on_unload` to release the loaded GGUF model on exit.
- No Ollama, no cloud API, no internet required at runtime.
- Dependencies: `llama-cpp-python` (auto-prompted on first launch).

### Trial Link Scanner (`trial_link_scanner`)
Scans direct messages collected during scraping for OnlyFans trial/free-trial links (`https://onlyfans.com/<creator>/trial/<token>`). Logs all matches to a daily log file and optionally posts Discord notifications with the message text, message date, and any attached images.
- Uses `on_scrape_start` to reset per-session dedup state before each run.
- Uses `on_posts_collected` to search raw HTML message text for trial URLs using a regex, extract attached image CDN URLs, and log or dispatch each match immediately.
- Uses `on_scrape_complete` to flush a collected summary to Discord (in `summary` timing mode).
- Uses `on_ui_setup` to add a **Trial Links** settings and log-viewer page to the sidebar.
- Images are downloaded locally first (OnlyFans CDN URLs are IP-restricted) then uploaded directly to Discord as file attachments.
- No external dependencies beyond `requests` (already a dependency of ofscraper).
