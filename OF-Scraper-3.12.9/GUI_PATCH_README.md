# Work in progress OF-Scraper 3.12.9 GUI Patch. There may be bugs/issues

A self-contained Python script that patches an installed copy of [OF-Scraper](https://github.com/datawhores/OF-Scraper) v3.12.9 to add a full **PyQt6 GUI** accessible via the `--gui` flag.

## What it does

- Adds a (Catppuccin-inspired) dark/light theme GUI to OF-Scraper with pages for:
  - **Scraper** — select actions, content areas, and models with a filterable table
  - **Authentication** — edit credentials, import cookies from your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, etc.), auto-detect User Agent
  - **Configuration** — edit all config.json settings across tabbed sections (General, File Options, Download, Performance, Content, CDM, Advanced, Response Type, Overwrites)
  - **Profiles** — create, rename, delete, and switch profiles
  - **Merge DBs** — merge model databases
  - **Help / README** — built-in documentation with table of contents and section jump links
- Installs **PyQt6** automatically using the correct method for your setup
- Creates a **timestamped backup** of all original files before patching
- Supports `--restore` to revert to the original files from a backup

## GUI features

### Theme
- Toggle between **Dark** and **Light** mode using the button in the bottom-left navigation bar
- Theme preference is saved to `gui_settings.json` in your ofscraper config directory

### Context-sensitive help
- Every section and option throughout the GUI has a small **?** button next to it
- Clicking a **?** button navigates directly to the matching section in the Help / README page

### Startup dependency check
- On launch, the GUI checks whether **FFmpeg** and **CDM key paths** are configured
- If either is missing, a notice pops up with quick links to jump directly to the relevant config fields

### Auth failure handling
- When the model list cannot be loaded (auth error), a dialog appears offering:
  - **Retry** — re-fetch models without leaving the page
  - **Go to Authentication** — jump directly to the auth page
  - **Dynamic Mode (Config)** — jump directly to Configuration → Advanced → Dynamic Mode field
  - **Help / README** — navigate to the Auth Issues section of the built-in help
- A **Retry** button also appears inline in the navigation bar

### Scraper workflow
- **Area Selector page**: models are loaded from the API in the background while you configure options; an inline progress indicator shows loading state
- Filters configured on the Area Selector page are automatically carried over to the Table page sidebar when models are confirmed
- **Username filter** on the Area Selector page pre-narrows the Model Selector list

### Daemon mode (auto-repeat scraping)
- Enable from **Select Content Areas & Filters → Daemon Mode**
- Sets an interval (1–1440 minutes) for repeated scraping runs
- While waiting between runs, a **countdown timer** is shown in the table toolbar
- Optional **system tray notification** when each run starts (all platforms)
- Optional **sound alert** when each run starts (Windows)
- A **Stop Daemon** button appears in the toolbar; clicking it gracefully stops the loop after the current run

### Table page
- **Right-click** any cell to instantly filter the table by that cell's value
- Click any **column header** to sort by that column
- The footer shows the current row count and filtered vs total count (e.g. `42 / 1200 rows (filtered)`)
- The toolbar shows a live **Cart: N items** counter as you select rows for download
- **New Scrape** button: if scraping is active, confirms cancellation first; optionally resets all options and model selections back to defaults before returning to the start

### CLI auto-start
- If launched with `ofscraper --gui` together with action, area, and username flags, the GUI wizard is skipped and scraping begins automatically — matching the TUI behavior for scripted/automated workflows

### Help / README page
- Built-in documentation rendered from `GUI_HELP.md`
- **Jump to…** combo box for quick navigation to any section
- Full **table of contents** with clickable links; each TOC entry scrolls directly to the matching section
- **Additional Help** button links to the project Discord

## Supported platforms and install methods

| Platform | pip | pipx | uv |
|----------|:---:|:----:|:--:|
| Windows  | ✅  | ✅   | ✅ |
| Linux (Debian-based) | ❌  | ✅   | ✅ |
| Mac OS   | ❌ | ❌  | ❌ |
| Docker   | ❌ | ❌  | ❌ |

### Platform notes

- **Windows**: Tested on **Windows 11** but should work on Windows 10 and other versions
- **Linux**: Only **Debian-based** distributions are supported (Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, KDE Neon, Pop!_OS, etc.). Other distributions (Arch, Fedora, etc.) have not been tested and may require additional setup
- **Mac**: Mac OS has not been tested with this GUI patch.
- **Docker**: Not tested

### Python version

- **Supported**: Python **3.11.x** and **3.12.x**
- **Recommended**: Python **3.11.6** ([download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/))
- Python versions below 3.11 or 3.13+ are **not supported** and may cause issues with OF-Scraper or this patch
- The patch script will warn you if an unsupported Python version is detected

## How it detects your installation

The script automatically detects how OF-Scraper was installed by checking (in order):

1. **uv tool directories** — looks for ofscraper in `~/.local/share/uv/tools/` (Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\uv\tools\` (Windows)
2. **pipx virtual environments** — checks `~/.local/share/pipx/venvs/ofscraper/` (Linux) or `~\pipx\venvs\ofscraper\` (Windows), including the `$PIPX_HOME` environment variable
3. **Executable path** — runs `which ofscraper` / `where ofscraper` and infers the method from the path
4. **Python import** — attempts `import ofscraper` and locates the package via `__path__` (standard pip/venv installs)

## If OF-Scraper is not detected

If the script cannot find an existing installation, it presents an interactive menu:

```
ofscraper was not detected on this system.

Choose an option:
  1) Install ofscraper with pip
  2) Install ofscraper with pipx
  3) Install ofscraper with uv
  4) Specify install path manually (ofscraper is already installed)
  5) Exit

Enter choice (1-5):
```

- **Options 1-3** install OF-Scraper v3.12.9 using your chosen package manager, then continue with patching
- **Option 4** lets you provide the path to your ofscraper package directory manually (e.g. `/path/to/site-packages/ofscraper`). The script validates the path contains `__main__.py` before proceeding
- You can also use `--target /path/to/ofscraper` to skip detection entirely

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage — auto-detect and patch
python patch_ofscraper_3.12.9_gui.py

# Skip confirmation prompt
python patch_ofscraper_3.12.9_gui.py -y

# Dry run — see what would happen without making changes
python patch_ofscraper_3.12.9_gui.py --dry-run

# Specify install path manually
python patch_ofscraper_3.12.9_gui.py --target /path/to/site-packages/ofscraper

# Skip PyQt6 installation (if already installed)
python patch_ofscraper_3.12.9_gui.py --skip-pyqt6

# Restore original files from backup
python patch_ofscraper_3.12.9_gui.py --restore /path/to/backup
```

## After patching

Launch the GUI with:

```bash
ofscraper --gui
```

## Notes

- This patch is specifically for **OF-Scraper v3.12.9** — other versions are not supported
- A backup of all modified files is saved to your system temp directory before patching
- The `--restore` flag can undo the patch using any previous backup
- PyQt6 is installed automatically via the same package manager used for OF-Scraper (pip/pipx inject/uv)
- This was created with the help of AI and has been tested to the best of my ability. I take no responsibility for any damage or loss of data. Backups are recommended.
